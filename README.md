# 3D-Final-Projectile-Position-Python-
Simple Python script that calculates the final location of a projectile launched in 3D space after time t given an initial velocity, azimuth angle, altitude angle, and time t.

Note: i didn't verify if this thing is working yet because i am lazy. However, i am pretty sure the equations i used are correct.
